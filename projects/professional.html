    <h4>Client facing dashboard</h4>
    <p>
    I have architected and developed a client facing dashboard which is FUSE risk management platform.
    It provides insights, actionable items for their athletes and helps organizations to monitor assess and intervene for Industrial Athletes safety.
    It also contains new features to showcase for investors.</p>

    <h4>Game for clients onboarding and bootcamps</h4>
    <p>
    For clients to get familiarized with FUSE platform, I wrote a react based application which provides real-time safety score of Industrial Athletes.
    It gets last safety score after a game of tic-tac-toe where Athletes have to lift boxes labeled with crosses and zeroes and place it in 3X3 shelf.
    Immediately after completing a game, the players would see the safety score and the leaderboard.
