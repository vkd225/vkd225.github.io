		<h3>UI Component based on Angular 2 and D3</h3>

    <h3>React aware iFrame container</h3>
    <p>In one of the projects for a client, one of the part in a module was that I was trying to create a React aware iFrame. It is a widgets library, which would have multiple widgets based on ReactJs and you can drag and drop those widgets inside another container.</p>

    <p>Please find the github link <a href="https://vkd225.github.io/React-DragNDrop/">here</a></p>

    <h3>Alexa Skill</h3>
    <p>As a hackathon project, I created an Alexa Skill called Supernova and hosted it on AWS Lambda to give out company's information and notify employee about the meeting scheduled for the day and also if the visitor has arrived in the office area.</p>
